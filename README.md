- 👋 Hi, I’m @davechndr
- 👀 I’m interested in GitHub's resources for upskilling myself in programming languages [e.g., Python], and interacting with my peers [active on the community chat]. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to improve my skills and expertise. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how I can become a better data analyst/analytics person, improve my programming capabilities and explore related job opportunites, as my last assignment recently finished [on 12/1/2021]. 
- 📫 How to reach me ==> I can best be reached by email.
