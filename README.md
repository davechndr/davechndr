- 👋 Hi, I’m @davechndr
- 👀 I’m interested in GitHub's resources for learning new programming languages for data analytics, ML/AI and interacting with my peers who are active on the community chat. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how I can improve my programming capabilities and explore related job opportunites as my last assignment ended on 12/1/2021.
